## Research

There so many things I could look into in the OBA API, that it was very hard for me to decide what to go with.

In the beginning I just looked at all the data for a while and came up with a couple of things I could look into. This is what I came up with:

### 6 research questions

1.  Has the amount of released books about Disney increased or decreased over the last 10 years.
2.  Has the amount of pages in a childrenâ€™s book increased or decreased over the years?
3.  Has the amount of pages in books about movies changed over the years?
4.  **By how much has the amount of released school books changed over the past years?**
5.  By how much has the amount of e-books changed over the last years.
6.  **Has in The Netherlands the ratio between men and women who write novels changed over the years?**

The two **bold** research questions (number 4 and 6) were the ones that I found most interesting. Because I couldn't decide yet, I just didn't. I started thinking about what variables I would need for *both* and about what sub-questions I could come up with for *both*.

### Variables for number 4:

-   Book type (whether it's a school book or not)
-   Year of publication

### Sub-questions for number 4:

-   How many books were published in 2017?
-   In which year were the most books published?
-   In which year were the least books published?
-   Between which years did the amount of published books change the most?

### Variables for number 6:

-   Book genre (novel)
    Name of the author
-   Gender of the author
-   Year of publication

### Sub-questions for number 6:

-   How many men published a novel in 2017?
-   How many woman published a novel in 2017?
-   In which year did most woman publish a novel?
-   In which year did most men publish a novel?
-   How many male authors write novels?
-   How many female authors write novels?
-   In what year was the ratio the biggest?

### Decision

I decided to go with research question number 6:
**By how much has in The Netherlands the ratio between men and women who write novels changed over the years?**

After I made that decision, I thought of what I expected and came up with my __hypothesis__:

Over the last years difference between the ratio of men and woman who write novels has become bigger because men write less novels.

waarom line chart  
met lijnen kon ik beste ratio vergelijken volgens Laurens , je let op tijd
minder jaren want anders veel te veel requests sturen
