## Process

### Day 1

- Introduction day.
- Mark introduced the project
- Titus gave a bootcamp about javascript
- Started to recieve data using rijkvanzantens' repo
- Coulnd't do it because got a lot of errors. This was because I didn't have XCode on my MacBook, because of the latest update. Had to install it but because the wifi wasn't great it took a very long time.

### Day 2
- Installed XCode because installation wasn't completed the day before
- We sat at school
- Got research questions from the data

#### 5 things I could visualise based on the data

1. Has the amount of released books about Disney increased or decreased over the last 10 years.
2. Has the amount of pages in a childrenâ€™s book increased or decreased over the years?
3. Has the amount of pages in books about movies changed over the years?
4. __By how much has the amount of released school books changed over the past years?__
5. By how much has the amount of e-books changed over the last years.
6. __Has the ratio between men and women who write novels changed over the years?__



#### Decision
I decided to go with research question number 6:
__Has the ratio between men and women who write novels changed over the years?__


### Day 3

- Talked about my research questions with Linda, to improve then
- Though of my sub-questions
- Thought of my hypothesis
- Got Dennis' code and used it
- Titus and Laurens gave bootcamps with a lot of info
- Standup

I couldn't decide for a long time whether to go with research question number 4 or 6.  
So I thought of the sub-questions and variables I would need for both, and decided which one to go with after.

#### Variables for number 4:
- Book type (whether it's a school book or not)
- Year of publication

#### Sub-questions for number 4:
- How many books were published in 2017?
- In which year where the most books published?
- In which year where the least books published?

#### Variables for number 6:
- Book genre (novel)
- Gender of the author
- Year of publication

#### Sub-questions for number 6:
- How many men published a novel in 2017?
- How many woman published a novel in 2017?
- In which year did most woman publish a novel?
- In which year did most men publish a novel?
- How many male authors write novels?
- How many female authors write novels?
- In what year was the ratio the biggest?

#### Hypothesis
Years ago the difference in the ratio of men and women who write novels was smaller than it is now.

### Day 4

- stappenplan gemaakt
- hypothese gemaakt
- veel kwartjes vielen
- alle data op kunnen halen

How am I going to do this:
1. Filter on only books
2. Filter on novels
3. Filter per year
4. Make sure you can see the names of the author
5. find out the gender of the author
6. compare everything


- we hadden geen zitplek
- dus met zn alle in zaal
- #### get only books
  door `facet: 'type(book)'`
- #### get only novels
When I search for 'novels' in titles I get books, but it gives me books with different genres. Now I added it as Facet by putting `facet: 'genre(noveltisch-verhaal)'`
- ### Filter per year
`'pubYear(2000)'`
-
